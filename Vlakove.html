     <h2>Big Boy</h2>
   <p>
    The Big Boy is a legendary series of massive steam locomotives built in the 1940s by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) for the Union Pacific Railroad. Designed to haul heavy freight <br>
     over steep grades, particularly the Wasatch Mountains between Utah and Wyoming, each Big Boy locomotive is nearly 133 feet long and weighs 1.2 million pounds. With a 4-8-8-4 wheel <br>
      configuration (four leading wheels, two sets of eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels), it was the largest and one of the most powerful steam locomotives ever built. <br>
      Only 25 Big Boys were produced, and today, a few are preserved in museums, with one, UP 4014, restored to operational condition in 2019 by Union Pacific, bringing its powerful <br>
       presence back to the rails for special excursions. <br>
